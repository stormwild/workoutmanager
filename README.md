# Workout Manager

Swing project to manage fitness workouts.

## Notes

### Reference Current Working Directory

When running a jar file from the command line, the directory where the command was executed is the current working directory.

It may not necessarily be the directory of the jar file.

So if I am on 

(/c/myfolder) $ java /d/myjar.jar

the current working directory is /c/myfolder

If I want to reference the directory of the jar file -- how?

Aargh so many ways, which one?
